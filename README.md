Web Resource Tracker
=====================

Note this is a quick test project using MeteorJS (http://meteor.com).

Allows users to add different categories and post resources under those categories along with name, description and url to access the resource online.

There is an annoying bug currently with how the accordion is expanded and closed when other users are adding resources.

Example is hosted at meteor:
